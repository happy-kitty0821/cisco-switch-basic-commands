# Networking Practical Exploration

Welcome to the Networking Practical Exploration repository! This repository is designed to accompany the practical part of our networking course, where we will delve into hands-on networking experiences using Cisco switches.

## Introduction

In this practical phase of our course, we will shift our focus from theoretical concepts to real-world implementations. By working with actual network devices, such as Cisco switches, we will gain valuable practical skills that are highly sought after in the networking industry.

## Topics Covered

During this practical exploration, we will cover a range of important networking topics, including:

- Port Security: Configuring and securing switch ports to prevent unauthorized access.
- SSH (Secure Shell): Establishing secure remote access to network devices.
- Telnet: Exploring Telnet for remote management of network devices.
- VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network): Configuring and managing logical network segments.
- Trunking: Configuring trunk links to efficiently transmit data between switches.
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Setting up dynamic IP address assignment.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into files, each file representing a specific topic we will cover. Inside each file, you will find detailed instructions, configuration examples, and exercises to practice your skills.

Feel free to explore the different files and work through the exercises at your own pace. Make sure to read the instructions carefully, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you encounter any difficulties.

## Getting Started

To get started with the practical exercises, you will need access to Cisco switches and a terminal emulator software, such as PuTTY. Follow the instructions provided in each folder to set up your lab environment and begin practicing.
Or you can even use cisco packet tracer if you do not have access to cisco devices.
