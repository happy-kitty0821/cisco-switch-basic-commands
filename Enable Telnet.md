To enable Telnet on a Cisco switch, follow these steps using the command-line interface (CLI):

1. Access Privileged EXEC Mode: Connect to the switch using a console cable and terminal emulation software. Enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```
   enable
   ```

2. Enter Global Configuration Mode: Enter global configuration mode by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

   ```
   configure terminal
   ```

3. Generate Encryption Keys (Optional): If encryption is desired for Telnet sessions, generate encryption keys using the following command:

   ```
   crypto key generate rsa
   ```

   You will be prompted to choose the key modulus size. The recommended size is 1024 bits.

4. Enable Telnet: To enable Telnet on the switch, use the following command:

   ```
   line vty 0 15
   ```

5. Set Telnet Password: Set a password for Telnet access. Use the following command to set the password:

   ```
   password <password>
   ```

   Replace `<password>` with the desired password for Telnet access.

6. Configure Login Authentication: Specify the authentication method for Telnet login. You can use the local database on the switch or an external authentication server. To use the local database, enter the following command:

   ```
   login local
   ```

7. Set Exec-Timeout: Configure the time duration of inactivity before an idle Telnet session is terminated. Use the following command to set the exec-timeout:

   ```
   exec-timeout <minutes>
   ```

   Replace `<minutes>` with the desired number of minutes of inactivity before the session times out.

8. Save Configuration: After configuring Telnet, save the configuration changes. Enter the following command to exit the interface configuration mode:

   ```
   end
   ```

   Then, save the configuration to the startup configuration file using the following command:

   ```
   write memory
   ```

That's it! You have successfully enabled Telnet on the Cisco switch. Now, you can remotely access the switch using Telnet by establishing a Telnet session from a computer or another network device. Remember to secure your Telnet access by using strong passwords and considering additional security measures, such as enabling SSH for secure remote access.
